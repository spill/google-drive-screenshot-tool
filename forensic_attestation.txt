
FORENSIC INTEGRITY ATTESTATION
======================================================================

Verification Timestamp: 2025-10-26T17:57:31.679875
Total Files Examined: 3

METADATA HASH VERIFICATION:
  Before Hash (SHA-256): 50ce8c5708218dcba853b2623c87bc1c618fabb8b5d97b67ae9f9b37613da54b
  After Hash (SHA-256):  50ce8c5708218dcba853b2623c87bc1c618fabb8b5d97b67ae9f9b37613da54b
  
RESULT: [PASS] HASHES MATCH

ATTESTATION:
I hereby attest that cryptographic hash verification confirms no 
modifications were made to file metadata during the screenshot capture 
process. The SHA-256 hashes of all file metadata remained identical 
before and after the documentation process.

This verification proves that critical forensic timestamps including:
- Created Time
- Modified Time  
- Viewed By Me Time (Last Opened)

remained unaltered during evidence collection.
